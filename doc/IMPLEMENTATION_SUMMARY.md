- **Tablet (768-1439px)**: 2-column layout, right sidebar hidden
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Single column, drawer navigation (planned)

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
Mock Data (mockData.ts)
    ↓
Page Components
    ↓
UI Components
    ↓
User Interface
```

All data is static and defined in `app/data/mockData.ts`, making it easy to:
- Update mock values
- Add new data entries
- Replace with real API calls (future)

## 🎯 Following Design System Rules

Every component and page follows these principles:
1. ✅ Uses design tokens (no hardcoded values)
2. ✅ Consistent spacing (8px grid)
3. ✅ Color palette compliance
4. ✅ Typography hierarchy
5. ✅ Border radius standards
6. ✅ Shadow system
7. ✅ Hover and focus states
8. ✅ Accessibility considerations

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- ✅ 'use client' directives only where needed
- ✅ Optimized re-renders with React best practices
- ✅ Efficient component structure
- ✅ Minimal bundle size
- ✅ CSS-based animations (no JS)
- ✅ Lazy loading ready (Next.js default)

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Consistent code formatting
- ✅ Semantic HTML
- ✅ ARIA labels where needed
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
